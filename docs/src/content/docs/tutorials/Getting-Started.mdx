import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. [Install mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
1. Install the extension from the
   [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hverlin.mise-vscode#overview)
   or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/hverlin/mise-vscode)
1. **Recommended:** Install a TOML extension for syntax highlighting and autocompletion:
  - [Tombi TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombi-toml.tombi)
  - [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) (works well but [not actively maintained anymore](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo/issues/715)). The extension will notify you if neither is installed.
1. Open a project with a `mise.toml` file (or any other files supported by mise)

</Steps>

The extension should now be activated. You can access the features using:
   - The sidebar `terminal` icon in the activity bar (usually on the left)
   - Command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`). Search for `Run Mise Task` or
     `Open Tool definition` or `Open Mise Task definition`
   - The status bar at the bottom of the window

Everything should work out of the box if your `mise` setup is standard.
