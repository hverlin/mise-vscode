## Important defaults

There are a few important defaults that you should be aware of when using this extension. For most users, the default settings should work fine but you might want to change them depending on your needs.

### Finding the `mise` executable

By default, the extension will try to find the `mise` executable on the `PATH`. Otherwise, it will try a few common locations and update the [`mise.binPath`](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#misebinpath) setting automatically.

This might not work for you so make sure to update it manually if needed. You can also turn off the automatic detection if needed

### Automatic configuration of VS Code extensions

By default, this extension will modify your `.vscode/settings.json` file so that [other extensions](/mise-vscode/reference/supported-extensions/) you use will use the tools you installed with `mise`.

**This might be a problem if you are sharing the `.vscode/settings.json` file with others.** (e.g., in a Git repository)

- This can be [turned off](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseconfigureextensionsautomatically) if you don't want this behavior.
- Alternatively, you can configure the extension to create symlinks to tools so that the settings points to a relative path in your project. Use [`mise.configureExtensionsUseSymLinks`](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseconfigureextensionsusesymlinks) for this.

<summary>About sharing `.vscode/settings.json`</summary>

If you are sharing the `.vscode/settings.json` file with others, you might think that the default value of this extension is not a good idea.

However, there are some challenges with sharing `.vscode/settings.json`:
  - If you use extensions other members of your team don't have, you won't be able to update the settings file without conflicts.
  - If you would like some settings to be different for different members of your team, you won't be able to do so.

Ideally, VS Code should support a `settings.local.json` file that would be ignored by git. See [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/40233) for more information.

If you want to share some settings with others, here are some good workarounds:
  - Git ignore the `.vscode/settings.json` file. Create a `settings.shared.json` file that other can use as a reference. Set up a `mise` task to populate your `settings.json` file with the content of `settings.shared.json` if needed.
  - Use extension such as [workspace-config-plus](https://github.com/swellaby/vscode-workspace-config-plus) to have a `settings.local.json` file that is ignored by git.

#### Controlling which extensions are configured automatically

You can control which supported extensions are automatically configured by mise-vscode using the following settings in your VS Code settings (user or workspace):

- [`mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIgnoreList`](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseconfigureextensionsautomaticallyignorelist): List of extensions that should **not** be configured automatically.
- [`mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList`](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseconfigureextensionsautomaticallyincludelist): List of extensions that **should** be configured automatically.

**How it works:**
- If the **include** list is set and non-empty, only extensions in this list are considered for automatic configuration.
- If both **include** and **ignore** lists are set, the ignore list takes precedence (extensions in the ignore list are always excluded).
- If the **include** list contains `"all"`, all supported extensions are considered (except those in the ignore list).
- If the **include** list is empty or not set, no extensions are configured automatically, and the extension will not modify your `.vscode/settings.json` file.
- If [`mise.configureExtensionsAutomatically`](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseconfigureextensionsautomatically) is set to `false`, no extensions will be configured automatically, regardless of the include or ignore lists.

You can find the full list of supported extensions in the [Supported Extensions](/mise-vscode/reference/supported-extensions/) documentation.

Example usage in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList": ["ms-python.python", "golang.go"],
  "mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIgnoreList": ["denoland.vscode-deno"]
}
```

This will configure only Python and Go extensions, and will always ignore Deno, even if it is in the include list.

#### Advanced: Fine-grained control with user and workspace settings

You can take advantage of VS Code's user and workspace settings to control which extensions are configured automatically at different levels.
For example, you can set a global default at the **user** level and then override it at the **workspace** level for specific projects.

This allows you to have a flexible setup where you can control which extensions are configured automatically based on your needs.

To do this, set the `mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList` to an empty array at the **user** level, and then specify the desired extensions at the **workspace** level in your `.vscode/settings.json` file.

**User settings (`settings.json`):**
```json
{
  "mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList": []
}
```

**Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):**
```json
{
    "mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList": [
        "denoland.vscode-deno"
    ]
}
```

With this setup, only the deno extensions will be configured automatically for your project. However, if you open another project that does not specify the `mise.configureExtensionsAutomaticallyIncludeList`, no extensions will be configured automatically.

**Note that updating this setting might require you to reload the VS Code window for the changes to take effect.**

### Automatic loading of environment variables

The extension will load the environment variables provided by `mise` and update the VS Code process with them.

This is generally a useful feature, though it might have unwanted side effects among which:
- showing a warning icon indicating that you need to restart your terminal when some environment variables are updated
- if you use the VS Code terminal and leave the current directory (with e.g. `cd ..`), the environment variables will still be there (whereas if it's off, `mise` will unload the environment variables when you leave the directory)
You can [turn this off](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#miseupdateenvautomatically) if needed.


### Additional notes

The extension will prompt you if a new mise version is available to help to be up-to-date. You can [turn this off](/mise-vscode/reference/settings/#misecheckfornewmiseversion) if you don't want to see this message.

I try to not show too many notifications in general. If there is one that you would like to ignore and cannot find a way to do so, please let me know by opening an issue.
